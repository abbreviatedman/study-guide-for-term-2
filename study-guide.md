# Study Guide For Term 2

### Codewars

One of the best ways to study for term 2 is just to sharpen your JavaScript skills. So! Here are a handful of problems that will require you to get your hands pretty dirty.

* [Extending JavaScript Objects](https://www.codewars.com/kata/581351c40d8f13bc450008b8/javascript) is a great one for learning how to add a method to a class that already exists--in this case, the built-in Array class. Did you know you can make arrays have a new method? You can! You'll have to do some research to figure out how, but you'll for sure learn something. And if you enjoy that kind of thing, check out others in that series!
* [Javascript filter - 3](https://www.codewars.com/kata/525f0459fb9570f9ff00005d/javascript) will make you learn about the abilities that filter has. Check out the MDN article for `filter` (linked in the Codewars instructions).
* [Break camelCase](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5208f99aee097e6552000148/javascript) - a good string-building exercise.
* [Array to HTML Table](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5e7e4b7cd889f7001728fd4a) - a quite difficult exercise in building HTML out of an array. A hearty challenge, but doable!
